The essence of Projects Committee is simple: some people want to work on things,
and others want to do things, we make it happen.

Got a project? Want to work on a project? Questions?  
Contact projects at <projects@sse.se.rit.edu>
  
To see a list of on going projects, you can check out our [github org](https://github.com/rit-sse)
